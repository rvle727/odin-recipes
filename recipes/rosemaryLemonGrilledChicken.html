    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rosemary-lemon grilled chicken features chicken, often breasts, marinated or brushed with a flavorful combination of lemon juice, zest, fresh rosemary, garlic, and olive oil, then grilled until tender and juicy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts with marinade. Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting mixture, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill, and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture.</li>
    </ol>
